# 2D-music-visualizer

This is going to be cooooool XD

Instructions to run the application: 
1. (For some reason WebAudio Api sometimes doesn’t work on Safari, so just to be safe, run the application on Chrome if at all possible).
2. Installations: 
  pip install flask
  pip install werkzeug
  brew install pkg-config gcc readline sqlite gdbm freetype libpng
  brew install libyaml fftw ffmpeg libsamplerate libtag
  pip install ipython numpy matplotlib pyyaml
  pip install essentia
3. Navigate inside /2D-music-visualizer and run python main.py
4. Copy the prompted link into web browser to see application running (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:4624/). If it says “Address already in use”, go into main.py and scroll down to the bottom and change the port number.  
5. Upload a song file (mp3, m4a, wav, aiff, or flac) where it says “Choose file”
6. Wait while it’s loading… Good things come to those who wait!
7. Enjoy a fractal visualization of your favorite song! 
8. Feel free to upload another song file! And be patient!
